# GitHub Teams

In order to ease notifying folks with a common expertise or interest, the WHATWG uses GitHub teams. The WHATWG uses teams in the following manner:

* Anyone can join any team they desire. To join just let someone know or [file an issue](https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/new).
* Everyone tries to ensure the appropriate teams are [mentioned](https://github.com/blog/1121-introducing-team-mentions) on relevant issues/pull requests.
* Teams have no formal authority, though we might add them as contributors to repositories for ease of collaboration. For all repositories we care about protecting master primarily. The bar for write access to other branches is much much lower.
* Teams have no responsibility either. If you ping a team and get no feedback, moving things forward responsibly is still on you.
* To propose a new team, [file an issue](https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/new). We will approve most teams unless they are a niche or overlap with an existing team.
