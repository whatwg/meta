# WHATWG GitHub Labels

There is currently no WHATWG-wide label policy, except for:

* i18n-comment: used by the internationalization community to track issues they have raised.
* i18n-tracking: used by the internationalization community to track issues they are interested in or the WHATWG community thinks the internationalization community might be interested in.

Using these labels results in digest email to [www-international](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/).
