# GitHub Labels

There is currently no WHATWG-wide label policy, except for:

* [good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aopen): identifies issues someone new to a WHATWG standard or software project can take on
* [i18n-comment](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-comment+is%3Aopen): used by the internationalization community to track issues they have raised.
* [i18n-tracking](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-tracking+is%3Aopen): used by the internationalization community to track issues they are interested in or the WHATWG community thinks the internationalization community might be interested in.
* [anchor-permanence](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Aanchor-permanence): identifies issues opened by other standards organizations or documentation curators indicating to an editor that a certain anchor is being referenced and should work forever.

Using these labels results in digest email to [www-international](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/).
