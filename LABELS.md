# GitHub Labels

There is currently no WHATWG-wide label policy, except for:

* [good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aopen): identifies issues someone new to a WHATWG standard or software project can take on
* [i18n-comment](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-comment+is%3Aopen): used by the internationalization community to track issues they have raised.
* [i18n-tracking](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-tracking+is%3Aopen): used by the internationalization community to track issues they are interested in or the WHATWG community thinks the internationalization community might be interested in.
* [i18n-alreq](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-alreq+is%3Aopen): used by the internationalization community to notify arabic script experts of relevant issues. Other labels with the same function include [i18n-clreq](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-clreq+is%3Aopen), [i18n-hlreq](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-hlreq+is%3Aopen), [i18n-ilreq](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-ilreq+is%3Aopen), [i18n-jlreq](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-jlreq+is%3Aopen), [i18n-klreq](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Ai18n-klreq+is%3Aopen) (others will be added as needed).
* [anchor permanence](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3Aanchor+permanence): identifies issues opened by other standards organizations, under our [anchor permanence policy](https://whatwg.org/working-mode#anchors), indicating to an editor that a certain anchor is being referenced and should work forever.
